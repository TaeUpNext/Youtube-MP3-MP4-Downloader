# Python Topics Used
* Variables
* pytube module/library
* while loops

# What are the zipped files
They allow you to run the app without needing to run the actual source code. If you unzip dist you will see the .app file for the program you should just need that. In case that doesn't work unzip the build folder too which holds all the contents that it was built with and it should work then
